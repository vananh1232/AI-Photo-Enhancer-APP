Visori is an AI-powered photo enhancer app, used to increase the quality of blurry or distorted images. In addition, users can also transform their photos using neural filters and turn their photos into artworks. The majority of my time working on the project was spent building an app that can deblurify photos, but with the remaining time that I had, I also added an option for neural filters to make my application more well-rounded for users.
